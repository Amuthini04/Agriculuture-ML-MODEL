# 🌾 Agriculture ML Model

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Agriculture ML Model** is a Machine Learning system designed to help farmers and agricultural planners make **smart crop and irrigation decisions**.  
Using soil, weather, and environmental data, the model predicts:
- The **most suitable crop** for given conditions
- Whether **irrigation is required**
- Expected **yield trends** (based on input patterns)

The repository contains multiple models to compare performance:
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- LightGBM

---

## 🎯 Features
- 📊 Predict best crops based on soil & climate.
- 💧 Suggest irrigation needs.
- 🔍 Compare multiple ML algorithms.
- ⚡ Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for experiments.
- 🛠 Can be extended with real-time farm sensor data.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains agricultural parameters such as:
- **Soil Type** (Clay, Sandy, Loamy, etc.)
- **Temperature** (°C)
- **Humidity** (%)
- **Rainfall** (mm)
- **Crop Labels** (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Cotton)
- **Irrigation Status** (Yes/No)

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values  
- Encode categorical variables (soil type, crop)  
- Scale numeric features for model training
